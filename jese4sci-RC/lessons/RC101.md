# RC101: Packaging an analysis

## Learning goals

1.  Install the prerequisite tools and software
2.  Describe a *research compendium*

## Prerequisites

Check to make sure your system meets these requirements.

1.  [RStudio ≥1.4](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

2.  [R ≥4.0](https://cran.r-project.org/)

3.  tidyverse `install.packages("tidyverse")`

4.  devtools `install.packages("devtools")`

    devtools can be a pain to install the first time. If you run into installation issues, you probably need to install [Rtools4](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) (if you're on Windows) or the Xcode command line tools (if you're on a Mac). *Don't* install the whole Xcode suite; it's 40GB of mostly stuff you don't need. Install *just* the command line tools by running `xcode-select --install` at the Terminal (not the R console).

5.  rrtools `devtools::install_github("benmarwick/rrtools")`

6.  [A GitHub account](https://github.com/join)

## Describe a research compendium

The research compendium is a framework for packaging the code, data, and manuscript for an analysis following a field's conventions. To understand the motivation for and implementation of research compendia, you have two options. You can read [Marwick et al. (2018)](Marwick%20et%20al.%20%20(2018).pdf) or watch 3:25 - 13:25 of the following ROpenSci Community Call, where Marwick presents that paper.

## Submit assignment

[Open an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart) in [FlukeAndFeather/jese4sci-RC](https://github.com/FlukeAndFeather/jese4sci-RC). Put "RC101" in the title. In the comment, answer the following questions.

1.  What version of the prerequisites do you have? This should include RStudio, R, tidyverse, devtools, and rrtools.
2.  In your words, how would you briefly describe a research compendium?
3.  Consider a paper you contributed to (whether you were on the author list or not). Were the data and code published with the paper? If so, how? Say another scientist wants to reproduce your results. What challenges do you think they would run into?
