# RC102: Introduction to GitHub

## Learning goals

1.  Set up version control
2.  Differentiate Git and GitHub

## Instructions

If you already feel comfortable with basic git commands (commit, push, pull) and you've connected RStudio to GitHub, you can skip this lesson. Otherwise, the following instructions will get you up and running. The [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com) book is a great resource for all things Git, GitHub, and R. Here, I refer you to the essential chapters to get started.

1.  What are Git and GitHub? If you're new to version control, or if you'd like a refresher on why version control matters, read [Bryan (2018)](Bryan%20(2018).pdf).

2.  [Install Git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)
