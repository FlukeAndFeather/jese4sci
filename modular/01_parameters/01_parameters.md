## `Parameterize` reflection

**Q1:** Choose a piece of code (~15-30 lines) and describe how you would parameterize it. This can be code you wrote, or you can search GitHub, StackOverflow, etc. In your description, specify:

* What task is the code snippet accomplishing?
* What _specific_ variables would you turn into _general_ parameters?
* What would you name this function?

**Q2:** _Encapsulation_ also makes it easy to read and understand your code. Read [_Functions are for humans and computers_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html#functions-are-for-humans-and-computers) from the R For Data Science book and take another look at your function name. Would replacing the code snippet with your function's name make the code more readable? After reading the R4DS section, would you revise the name?
