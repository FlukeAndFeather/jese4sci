# FP401: Manuscript

Now that you've obtained data, reproduced a figure or analysis of your choice, worked to document your code and make it modular and robust, and pulled it all together in a `.Rmd` file (in the style of [RC201](../../jese4sci-RC/lessons/RC201.md)), it's time to submit your completed project!

## Submission Instructions

Open an issue in [FlukeAndFeather/jese4sci](https://github.com/FlukeAndFeather/jese4sci) (put FP401 in the title), linking to your final project repository.
