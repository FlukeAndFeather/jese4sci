# FP202: Modular Analysis

Now that you've selected your study and acquired the data required to replicate the study's result(s), it's time to map out the steps you need to take to convert the data to the final figure or result visual. 

Create a chronological workflow of the methods and analyses you will use to produce the final result. 

Here is an example of what that could look like:  

data table --> laod as data frame --> apply model --> plot --> adjust legends, make points bigger, etc   

Each step in the workflow should correspond to a function you plan to write. Make sure they have clearly defined inputs and outputs.
