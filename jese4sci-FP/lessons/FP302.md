# FP302: Automating testing 

Let's create a procedure for automatically testing our code, to ensure that it works in the first place and also works the way we expect it to. 

In [VAL201](https://github.com/FlukeAndFeather/jese4sci-VAL/blob/master/VAL201.md), you learned how to write two different types of unit tests: smoke tests and boundary tests. Using the R unit testing package testthat, write two smoke tests and four boundary tests for your code.
